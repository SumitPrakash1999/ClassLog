**Lecture Plan: Variables, Solving Equations & Simple Harmonic Motion (60 minutes)**

**Objectives:** Students will be able to:

* Define and classify different types of variables (dependent, independent, controlled).
* Solve linear and simple quadratic equations algebraically.
* Define Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) and identify its key characteristics.
* Apply the equations of motion for SHM to solve basic problems.

**Activities:** (Time allocations are approximate)

**(I) Variables (15 minutes)**

* **Introduction (5 min):** Begin with a real-world example illustrating the concept of variables (e.g., distance traveled depending on speed and time). Define dependent, independent, and controlled variables with clear examples.  Use a whiteboard or projector to visually represent the relationships.
* **Activity: Categorizing Variables (5 min):**  Present students with a list of scenarios (e.g., plant growth depending on sunlight and water; a ball's trajectory affected by launch angle and initial velocity). Students will individually categorize the variables in each scenario.  Brief class discussion following.
* **Quick Check (5 min):** Short quiz (2-3 questions) to assess understanding of variable types. This can be done verbally or with a quick written response.

**(II) Solving Equations (20 minutes)**

* **Review (5 min):** Briefly review basic algebraic manipulation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) applied to equations.
* **Solving Linear Equations (7 min):**  Solve example linear equations step-by-step on the board, emphasizing the importance of maintaining balance.  Include examples with fractions and decimals.
* **Solving Simple Quadratic Equations (8 min):** Introduce solving quadratic equations by factoring (focus on simple cases). Work through 2-3 examples on the board. Mention other methods (quadratic formula) briefly, promising a more detailed explanation in a later lesson.

**(III) Simple Harmonic Motion (25 minutes)**

* **Introduction to SHM (5 min):** Define SHM, using examples like a mass on a spring or a simple pendulum. Explain the concepts of amplitude, period, frequency, and restoring force. Use animations or diagrams on slides to illustrate the motion.
* **Equations of Motion (10 min):** Introduce the basic equations for SHM (displacement, velocity, acceleration as functions of time). Derive these equations intuitively rather than rigorously.  Focus on understanding their meaning and application.
* **Problem Solving (10 min):** Work through 1-2 example problems applying the equations of SHM. Encourage student participation in solving the problems.

**Assessments:**

* Quick Check on variables (5 minutes).
* Participation in equation solving activities.
* Problem-solving exercise on SHM (can be assigned as homework or completed in class, depending on time).
* A short quiz at the end of the class covering all three topics (optional, depending on time available).


**Resources:**

* Slides with definitions, diagrams, equations, and example problems.
* Worksheet with variable categorization exercise and SHM problem-solving practice.
* Whiteboard or projector.
* Possibly short animation videos illustrating SHM.
