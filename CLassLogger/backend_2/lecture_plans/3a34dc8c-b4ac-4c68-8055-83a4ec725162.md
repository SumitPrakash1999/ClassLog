**Lecture Plan: Variables, Solving Equations, and Simple Harmonic Motion (60 minutes)**

**Objectives:**

* Students will be able to define and identify variables in mathematical expressions.
* Students will be able to solve linear and simple quadratic equations.
* Students will be able to define Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) and identify its characteristics.
* Students will be able to apply equations of motion to solve basic SHM problems.

**Activities:** (Time allocations are approximate)

**(I) Variables and Solving Equations (25 minutes)**

* **(5 minutes) Introduction to Variables:**  Begin with a brief review of what variables are and why they're important in mathematics and physics. Use real-world examples (e.g., distance = speed x time).  Engage students with a quick quiz (2-3 questions) on identifying variables in simple formulas.
* **(10 minutes) Solving Equations:**  Focus on linear equations and simple quadratic equations (those easily solvable by factoring). Work through several examples on the board, involving both algebraic manipulation and substitution. Encourage student participation by asking them to solve equations step-by-step.
* **(10 minutes) Practice Problems:**  Divide students into small groups (2-3 students) and give them a worksheet with 5-7 problems involving solving equations. Circulate, providing assistance as needed.


**(II) Simple Harmonic Motion (30 minutes)**

* **(5 minutes) Introduction to SHM:** Define SHM, its characteristics (restoring force proportional to displacement, oscillation about equilibrium), and provide real-world examples (pendulum, mass on a spring). Show visual aids (e.g., animations of SHM).
* **(10 minutes) Equations of Motion for SHM:** Introduce the basic equations for SHM (displacement, velocity, acceleration as functions of time).  Explain the meaning of amplitude, frequency, and period.  Use diagrams and clear explanations to link the equations to the physical motion.
* **(10 minutes) Problem Solving:** Present 2-3 example problems involving calculating displacement, velocity, or acceleration at specific times.  Solve these problems step-by-step on the board, emphasizing the application of the SHM equations.  Encourage student participation and questions.
* **(5 minutes) Wrap-up and Questions:** Summarize the key concepts of SHM and address any remaining student questions.


**(III)  Assessment & Conclusion (5 minutes)**

* **(2 minutes) Quick Quiz:**  A short quiz (2-3 questions) assessing understanding of key concepts from both sections.
* **(3 minutes)  Recap and Assignment:** Briefly summarize the main points of the lecture and assign homework problems that cover both equation solving and SHM.


**Assessments:**

* In-class quizzes (two short quizzes).
* Participation in group activities and problem-solving.
* Homework assignment.


**Resources:**

* PowerPoint slides with definitions, equations, diagrams, and examples.
* Worksheet with practice problems for solving equations.
* Worksheet with practice problems for SHM.
* Online simulations or animations demonstrating SHM (optional).


**Note:**  The time allocation can be adjusted based on the students' prior knowledge and understanding.  If students have strong algebra skills, less time may be needed for the equation-solving section.  Conversely, more time might be needed if they struggle with the concepts.  The instructor should be prepared to adapt the lecture plan as needed.
