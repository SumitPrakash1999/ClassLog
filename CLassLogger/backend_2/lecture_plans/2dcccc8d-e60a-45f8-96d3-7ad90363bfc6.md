**Lecture Plan: Variables and Solving Equations (60 minutes)**

**Objectives:**  Students will be able to:

* Define variables and understand their use in algebraic expressions.
* Translate word problems into algebraic equations.
* Solve one-step and two-step linear equations using various methods (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
* Check solutions to verify their accuracy.

**Activities:**

**(0-10 minutes) Introduction to Variables (10 minutes):**

* **Interactive Discussion (5 minutes):** Begin with a real-world example, e.g., calculating the cost of buying 'x' number of apples at $0.50 each.  Engage students in defining what 'x' represents (a variable). Discuss the concept of unknowns and placeholders. Use examples with varying contexts (age, distance, quantity).
* **Mini-Whiteboard Activity (5 minutes):** Present simple word problems involving variables. Students write the algebraic expressions representing the problems on mini-whiteboards, and their answers are reviewed collectively.  Example: "John has 5 more apples than Mary. If Mary has 'y' apples, how many does John have?"

**(10-30 minutes) Solving One-Step Equations (20 minutes):**

* **Lecture & Examples (10 minutes):** Explain the concept of solving equations as finding the value of the unknown variable. Introduce the concept of inverse operations (addition/subtraction, multiplication/division). Work through several examples of one-step equations on the board, clearly showing each step and emphasizing the need to maintain balance.  Include examples with integers and fractions.
* **Practice Problems (10 minutes):** Students work individually or in pairs on a worksheet containing various one-step equation problems.  Circulate to provide individual assistance.

**(30-50 minutes) Solving Two-Step Equations (20 minutes):**

* **Lecture & Examples (10 minutes):** Build upon the one-step equation knowledge by introducing two-step equations.  Demonstrate the order of operations (reverse PEMDAS/BODMAS) when solving these equations.  Work through several examples showing the step-by-step process, highlighting common errors to avoid.
* **Collaborative Problem Solving (10 minutes):** Divide students into small groups and provide more challenging two-step equation problems. Encourage peer teaching and discussion within the groups.


**(50-60 minutes) Wrap-up and Assessment (10 minutes):**

* **Review (5 minutes):** Briefly review the key concepts covered, emphasizing the importance of understanding inverse operations and maintaining equation balance.  Address any remaining student questions.
* **Exit Ticket (5 minutes):** Students individually answer one or two simple equation problems on a slip of paper to gauge understanding before leaving the class.


**Assessments:**

* Observation of student participation in discussions and activities.
* Review of completed worksheets.
* Analysis of exit ticket responses.

**Resources:**

* PowerPoint slides with examples and definitions.
* Worksheet containing one-step and two-step equation problems (with answer key).
* Mini-whiteboards and markers.
* Whiteboard or projector.


This plan provides a flexible framework.  The time allocated to each activity can be adjusted based on student understanding and engagement.  The complexity of the problems can also be modified to suit the students' level.
