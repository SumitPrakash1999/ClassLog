**Lecture Plan: Multiplication, Introduction to Fractions as Operators**

**Total Time:** 60 minutes

**Objectives:**  Students will be able to:

* Define multiplication as repeated addition.
* Understand the commutative and associative properties of multiplication.
* Represent multiplication using various models (e.g., arrays, number lines).
* Understand a fraction as an operator that signifies "of".
* Solve word problems involving multiplication and fractions as operators.


**Activities:**

**(I) Introduction to Multiplication (15 minutes)**

* **Activity 1:  Real-world examples (5 min):** Begin with real-world scenarios illustrating multiplication (e.g., buying 3 packs of 6 cookies, arranging chairs in rows).  Engage students in discussion about repeated addition.
* **Activity 2:  Visual Representations (5 min):** Use visual aids (slides with arrays, number lines) to demonstrate multiplication as repeated addition.  Show examples of 3 x 4 and 4 x 3 to highlight the commutative property.
* **Activity 3:  Practice Problems (5 min):**  Short, simple multiplication problems using arrays and number lines (e.g., 2 x 5, 6 x 2).  Students can work individually or in pairs.

**(II) Fractions as Operators (30 minutes)**

* **Activity 4:  Introducing "of" (10 min):**  Explain that a fraction can be interpreted as an operator meaning "of." For example, ½ of 8 means finding half of 8.  Use visual aids like fraction circles or bars to illustrate.
* **Activity 5:  Finding Fractions of Whole Numbers (10 min):**  Present problems involving finding a fraction of a whole number (e.g., ⅓ of 12, ¾ of 20). Guide students through different solution methods (visuals, division).
* **Activity 6:  Word Problems (10 min):** Present word problems that require finding a fraction of a quantity (e.g., "John ate ⅔ of a 12-slice pizza. How many slices did he eat?").  Students work individually or in small groups, then discuss solutions.


**(III) Conclusion and Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

* **Activity 7: Review (5 min):** Briefly review key concepts: multiplication as repeated addition, commutative property, fractions as operators.
* **Activity 8:  Q&A (5 min):** Address any student questions or confusion.
* **Activity 9:  Exit Ticket (5 min):**  A short, one or two-question quiz to assess understanding of the key concepts (finding a fraction of a whole number and solving a simple word problem).


**Assessments:**

* Observation of student participation in activities and discussions.
* Completion of practice problems.
* Performance on the exit ticket.


**Resources:**

* PowerPoint slides with visuals (arrays, number lines, fraction models).
* Worksheet with practice problems (both multiplication and fraction-of problems).
* Fraction circles or bars (physical or digital).
* Whiteboard or projector.


**Note:**  The time allocation for each activity can be adjusted based on student understanding and engagement.  It's important to monitor student progress and adapt the pace accordingly.  The exit ticket can be graded quickly to inform future instruction.
