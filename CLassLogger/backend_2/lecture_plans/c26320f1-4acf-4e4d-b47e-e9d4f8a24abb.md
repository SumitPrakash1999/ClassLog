**Lecture Plan: Variables and Solving Equations (60 minutes)**

**Objectives:**  Students will be able to:

* Define a variable and understand its use in algebraic expressions.
* Identify different types of equations (linear, etc.).
* Solve one-step and two-step linear equations.
* Apply equation-solving techniques to real-world problems.


**Activities:** (Time allocation in parentheses)

1. **Introduction to Variables (10 minutes):**
    * Begin with a real-world example demonstrating the need for variables (e.g., calculating the cost of buying x apples at $y per apple).
    * Define variables and explain their purpose in representing unknown quantities.
    * Provide examples of different variable notations (x, y, a, etc.) and their use in simple expressions.  Include practice with substituting values into expressions.

2. **Types of Equations (5 minutes):**
    * Briefly introduce the concept of equations (expressions with an equals sign).
    * Differentiate between different types of equations (focus on linear equations for this lecture).
    * Provide examples of simple linear equations.

3. **Solving One-Step Equations (15 minutes):**
    * Explain the concept of inverse operations (addition/subtraction, multiplication/division).
    * Demonstrate solving one-step equations using inverse operations with numerous examples. (Include examples with both positive and negative numbers).
    * Encourage student participation by solving equations on the board together.

4. **Solving Two-Step Equations (15 minutes):**
    * Build upon one-step equation solving by introducing two-step equations.
    * Emphasize the order of operations (reverse PEMDAS/BODMAS) when solving.
    * Work through several examples step-by-step, highlighting each operation.
    * Include examples with fractions and decimals.

5. **Real-World Applications (10 minutes):**
    * Present real-world problems that can be solved using linear equations.
    * Guide students through translating word problems into algebraic equations and solving them.
    * Encourage students to identify the unknown variable and formulate the equation.

6. **Wrap-up and Q&A (5 minutes):**
    * Briefly summarize the key concepts covered in the lecture.
    * Allow time for students to ask questions and clarify any doubts.


**Assessments:**

* **In-class participation:** Active engagement during problem-solving activities.
* **Short quiz:** A brief quiz (5-7 questions) at the end of the lecture testing understanding of variable usage and solving one and two-step equations. This could be a paper quiz or an online form depending on resources.


**Resources:**

* PowerPoint slides summarizing key concepts and examples.  These slides should contain clear visual representations of the steps involved in solving equations.
* Worksheet with practice problems on solving one-step and two-step equations, including word problems.  This worksheet should have a range of difficulty levels.
* Optional: Online equation solver for students to check their answers (used judiciously to avoid over-reliance).


This plan allows for flexibility.  The time allocated to each activity can be adjusted depending on student understanding and engagement.  The instructor should be prepared to adapt the pace and content as needed.
